    <h1>About Our Company</h1>
    <p>
        Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche , is a German automobile manufacturer specializing in luxury, high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans, headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.<br> The company is owned
        by Volkswagen AG, a controlling stake of which is owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE.<br> Porsche's current lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan. The origins of the company date to the 1930s when Czech-German automotive
        engineer Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche with Adolf Rosenberger, a keystone figure in the creation of German automotive manufacturer and Audi precursor Auto Union,<br> and Austrian businessman Anton Piëch, who was, at the time, also Ferdinand
        Porsche's son in law.<br> In its early days, it was contracted by the German government to create a vehicle for the masses, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle.<br> After World War II, when Ferdinand would be arrested for war crimes, his
        son Ferry Porsche began building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.<br> In 2009, Porsche entered an agreement with Volkswagen to create an 'integrated working group' by merging the two companies ' car manufacturing operations.<br>        By 2015, Porsche SE, the holding company spun off from the original Porsche firm, had a controlling interest in the Volkswagen Group, which included Audi and Lamborghini as subsidiaries.<br> History Origin Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded
        the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger and Anton Piëch in 1931.
        <br> The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche 's full title in German, Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa lit.'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree ' Ferdinand Porsche.The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.<br>Initially,
        the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.<br>        This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.Later, the Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.<br>The first models of what was to become the 356 were built in
        a small sawmill in Gmünd, Austria. The prototype car was shown to German auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production (with aluminum body) was begun by Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise. Many regard
        the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the first model sold by the fledgling company.<br> After production of the 356 was taken over by the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950, Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based
        company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356 's steel body.<br> In 1952, Porsche constructed an assembly plant across the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main
        road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche building, is now known as Porschestrasse.<br> The 356 was road-certified in 1948.Porsche's company logo stems from the coat of arms of the Free People's State of Württemberg of Weimar Germany of 1918–1933,
        which had Stuttgart as its capital. (The Bundesland of Württemberg-Hohenzollern used the same arms from 1945 to 1952, while Stuttgart during these years operated as the capital of adjacent Württemberg-Baden.) The arms of Stuttgart appear in the
        middle of the logo as an inescutcheon, for the company had its headquarters in Stuttgart. The heraldic symbols, combined with the texts "Porsche" and "Stuttgart", do not form a conventional coat of arms, since heraldic achievements never spell
        out the name of the armiger nor the armiger's home town in the shield.Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern both in 1952 became part of the present Bundesland of Baden-Württemberg after the political consolidation of West Germany in 1949,
        but the old design of the arms of Württemberg lives on in the Porsche logo. On 30 January 1951, not long before the formation of Baden-Württemberg, Ferdinand Porsche died from complications following a stroke.
